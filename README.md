## Back\-face removal/culling in world space using the dot product \(3D programming\)


</div>

### Description

This tutorial focuses on the use of the Dot Product of two vectors for back-face culling/removal in world space. Back-face removal is the process of checking every polygon before it is drawn to screen space to see whether it is facing the camera or not (ie. whether the camera can see it). If it isn't visible to the camera then there is no point in drawing it. Drawing it would just use unnecessary CPU power. This tutorial teaches you the basics of using this incredibly useful function in 3D game programming. It can significantly increase your frame rate!
